# Introduction

An Elixir playground based on the Todo application built in [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition) to test various things like deployment with Kubernetes, releases with distillery, etc.

# More things to do

- Find how a service should be exposed in K8S
- Intercept SIGTERM (when a pod is shutdown)
- Write real tests
- Typespecs
- Interact with a DB deployed with K8S, find how to have a nice dev workflow
